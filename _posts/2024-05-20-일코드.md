* If you like yourself more, you set higher standards for yourself, you persist longer.

* The more you like yourself, the more you like other people, the more you like
   other people, the more they like you and want to be in business with you.

* The more important you feel you are the more valuable you feel you are,
   the better is your health, and the better is your family.
