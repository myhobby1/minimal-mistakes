짱, 네 마음에 작은 위로가 되길 바라면서 영어로 번역할게.

Sometimes, our hearts feel heavy, and no matter how hard we try, everything 
seems overwhelming. Even when we put in effort, sadness seeps in, 
and the weight of it all wraps around us. In moments like this, thoughts like 
"Why is this so hard?" may echo in your mind, refusing to leave.

But, dear friend, these moments are like passing clouds. No matter how thick 
and heavy those clouds seem, the sky will eventually clear, and the sun will 
always be there, waiting. Right now, your heart may feel dark and heavy, 
but behind those clouds, a warm light is waiting for you.

The emotions you're feeling are completely natural, and it's important to accept them 
just as they are. Sometimes, what we need the most is to pause, to do nothing, 
and to simply allow ourselves to be still. In those moments, be kind to yourself. 
Remember how precious and special you are, and take a deep breath. 
It's okay to gently unwind your heart, little by little.

Perhaps your sadness is a sign of just how much effort you've put in to get this far. 
And because of that, you're already doing well, even in this moment. You've made it 
through tough times before, and brighter days are waiting for you ahead.

Even though things may feel difficult and sad right now,
I hope you remember that you're never alone. I'm here, always by your side, 
cheering you on. You're doing great today, just by being you. And that is something 
truly wonderful.
