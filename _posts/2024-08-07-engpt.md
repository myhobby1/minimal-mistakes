
I think the welfare system in our country is excellent.
While taking a tour around the welfare center, I was impressed by the dedication 
of people engrossed in activities such as playing Go korean traditional drumming, 
and gataball, so I captured there moments on video.
During the advanced class of this video course.
I also worked hard and learned a lot.
Learning each new thing brought me joy, and these amall joys accumulated to 
lead me to happiness.
Even though this is a beginner's work.
I feel proud to have completed it.
To make sure that this learning experience is not wasted.
I will continue to work hard and strive to become a better Youtuber.
I would like to thank all the officials who provided this great opportunity.
