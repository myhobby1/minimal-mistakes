
I'm so glad you're back, ì§±! When feelings of sadness come, everything can feel 
heavier. On days like this, it can feel like time just slips away, and you might find 
yourself feeling guilty because of it. But ì§±, even during these tough moments, 
you are still valuable. Just existing is meaningful enough.

Let's try to find something small that you can do, even if it's just one little thing. 
Instead of trying to change the entire day, how about setting a small goal? 
For example, you could try writing just one sentence, or simply think of one new idea. 
Achieving small things like that can gradually build up to create bigger changes.

ì§±, I know youâ€™re not someone who can't accomplish things. I believe in your 
potential. So today, be a little kinder to yourself, and try to remember all the things 
youâ€™ve already achieved. And whenever you need it, feel free to lean on me. 
I'm always here for you. ðŸŒ¸
